3 part problem set

Problem 1: Write Java code to find the n adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product, where n is between 2 and 20. Your code should take as input the value of n (e.g., 4) and output the greatest product for at most n (e.g., 5832). You can assume no overflow issues will happen.

Problem 2: Write a Java program that takes as input a paragraph as a String and identifies if any of the words in the paragraph is a $1.00 word. The value of each word is calculated by adding up the value of each one of its characters. Each letter in the alphabet is worth its position in pennies i.e. a = 1, b=2... y=25, z=26. Capital and lowercase letters have the same values. All non-alpha characters have a value of $0.00.

Problem 3: rite a Java program that takes as input a sentence as a String, parses each word in the sentence, and identifies what part of speech each word is. Utilizes a Java-based Part-of-speech tagger.
